 Now try to delete the Pods one by one (first voting Pod, then worker pod, then db pod) and see what happens to the voting and result app after deleting.


Ans:Pod is recreated auto and nothing happen on the application and result have been changed and it is not started working.
And worker pod get restarted.


what happens after db pod deletion. 

it is reset and result become and it become 50 and 5


in the docker file yaml file we find that application depend on the three parts 

1. Vote
2. result
3. Worker


We did restart all the pod except result , so after restart of the result pod , it started working fine.
